# Overlook
##### By: Nick Kasten

This is a `overlook`. An app that lets you make a side-by-side comparison of player data for the game **Overwatch**.

This takes advantage of the awesome data made available by the Overwatch API hosted at http://www.owapi.net and was made using React, React Router and Axios. Babel was used to transpile JSX and Webpack bundles it all together.

_Make sure to enter BattleTags with the format TEXT-NUMBER!_

#### To Install:

1. You must have a recent-ish version of Node.js installed along with the package manager `npm`.
2. `git clone` this repo and `cd` into it.
3. `npm install` will install the necessary dependencies.
4. `npm run start` will bundle the code and start the webpack-dev-server.
5. Browse to `http://localhost:8080`
